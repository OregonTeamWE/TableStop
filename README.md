## Project Goals

A list or paragraph outlining the engineering requirements
- Building an working Android application and deliver to Google Play Store
- An eBay Android application of searching and representation of products on eBay that relate to RPG tabletop games.
- Uses eBay public APIs and others
- Tabletop gaming tools to make fun shopping experience
- Github repository for develop team (project teammates and eBay engineers)
- Coding with Kotlin using the new google architecture is preferred than Java
- More requirements coming with the discussion with the partner

A list or paragraph outlining the constraints that might affect design
- This is an Android application which means we are not targeting the iOS users
- eBay is not quite a global e-commerce service provider, and the main target population is the users that are residents in United States
- Working in a 9-month time range could make the final result a little rough for a big company like eBay.
- Communication between group members and eBay engineers could be difficult since we are limited to online conferences.
- With so little information we know on the proposal, it will take time of discussing the details and further requirements or goals of this project
- Inclusive design for a population that is not tabletop gamer but wants affordable gaming gears or peripherals. 

A recommendation paragraph that includes
- Key skills that will be needed to complete the project
- Java experience
- Know how to use and merge different APIs
- Communication skill with project partner and eBay engineers
- Project management and workflow management
- Troubleshooting skills when stuck at some points
- Awareness of eBay or past experience shopping at eBay
- Team communication
- Technical writing skills

General list of equipment or resources that might be needed to facilitate design (e.g., GPUs; headsets)
- Devices that can perform the Android device simulator with no lag
- Good and stable internet connection
- Android Studio or other Android developer tools
- Official kotlin page: https://kotlinlang.org/
- Kotlin page for android development: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/android-overview.html
- Google official document of Android and Kotlin: https://developer.android.com/kotlin 
- Google design UI guide: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui 
- Google Android Studio overview: https://developer.android.com/studio/intro
